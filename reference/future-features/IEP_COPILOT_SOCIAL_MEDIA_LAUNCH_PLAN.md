## CROSS-PHASE STRATEGIES

### Brand Voice & Messaging

**For Advocates:**
- **Tone:** Professional, efficient, empowering
- **Key Messages:**
  - "Serve 3x more families without burning out"
  - "Automate the tedious, focus on advocacy"
  - "Your expertise + our AI = better outcomes for families"
- **Avoid:** Suggesting AI replaces advocates (it augments)

**For Parents:**
- **Tone:** Warm, supportive, empowering, hopeful
- **Key Messages:**
  - "You don't have to do this alone"
  - "Stop struggling, start advocating with confidence"
  - "Your child deserves every service in their IEP. We'll help you ensure they get it."
- **Avoid:** Jargon, overwhelm, blame toward schools

**For Districts:**
- **Tone:** Professional, data-driven, collaborative
- **Key Messages:**
  - "Improve parent engagement, reduce due process costs"
  - "Transparency builds trust with families"
  - "Partner with parents, not against them"
- **Avoid:** Adversarial language, suggesting districts are non-compliant

---

### Crisis Management & Negative Feedback

**Potential Crises:**

**1. AI Analysis Inaccuracy:**
- Parent claims AI gave wrong advice → Child didn't get services
- Response protocol:
  - Acknowledge immediately (within 2 hours)
  - Investigate internally
  - Offer free advocate consultation
  - Public response: "We're investigating. AI is a tool to empower, not replace expert judgment."
  - Follow-up: Improve AI accuracy, add disclaimers

**2. Privacy Breach:**
- Data leak, unauthorized access
- Response protocol:
  - Immediate legal/security team engagement
  - Notify affected users within 24 hours
  - Public statement: Transparency about what happened, steps taken
  - Offer: Free credit monitoring, account security review
  - Long-term: Third-party security audit, public report

**3. Negative Advocate/Parent Review:**
- "This tool doesn't work" or "Waste of money" on social media
- Response protocol:
  - Reply publicly within 4 hours
  - Empathize: "We're sorry to hear about your experience"
  - Take offline: "Let's discuss via DM or email"
  - Resolution: Refund, extended trial, personalized support
  - Learn: Identify if issue is widespread, improve product

**Social Media Guidelines:**
- Always respond to negative feedback (don't ignore)
- Never defensive or argumentative
- Empathy first, solution second
- Escalate to founder for serious issues

---

### Seasonal Strategies

**Back-to-School (August-September):**
- Parents most engaged with IEPs (annual reviews)
- Content: "IEP meeting prep for the new school year"
- Ads: Scale budget by 25% (highest intent period)
- Promotions: "Back-to-school special: First month free"

**IEP Season (Feb-May):**
- Peak IEP meeting season in most districts
- Content: "How to prepare for your spring IEP meeting"
- Webinars: Weekly meeting prep sessions
- Ads: Maintain high spend

**Summer (June-July):**
- Lower parent engagement (school's out)
- Content: "Planning for next year," "Understanding your child's progress report"
- Ads: Reduce budget by 25%, focus on advocates (they work year-round)
- Campaigns: Build email list for fall launch

**Holiday Season (November-December):**
- Lowest engagement period
- Content: Gratitude, community highlights, year in review
- Ads: Minimal spend (87% performance decrease in December)
- Internal: Plan Q1 strategy, analyze year's data

---

### Referral & Word-of-Mouth Amplification

**Built-In Viral Loops:**

**1. Advocate → Parent Referral:**
- Every advocate referring 3 parents = 3x multiplier
- White-label branding makes IEP Copilot part of advocate's service

**2. Parent → Parent Referral:**
- In-app referral: "Refer a friend, both get $10 credit"
- Natural sharing: "How did you prepare for your IEP meeting?" → "I used IEP Copilot"

**3. District → Parent Adoption:**
- District partnership = hundreds/thousands of parents at once
- Network effects: Parents see other parents using it

**Measurement:**
- Viral coefficient (K-factor): New users from referrals / Total users
- Goal: K-factor > 0.5 (each user brings 0.5 new users)
- Payback period: Time to recoup CAC via referrals
